This project is a simulation of a pool shot on a table. I used C code to write this project and have functions to set up the cushions, holes and balls.
The segment function can be called to simulate the shot returning when objects collide or when there are no more rolling balls or the max time is reached.
This project was created for an assignment in my CIS 2750 course (software development and integration)
